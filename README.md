# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Used ChatGPT to get kickstarted (although most of this code wasn't used). Also used for several code corrections. src = https://chat.openai.com/c/3566eac3-c866-44f4-8d9b-3f7ffef21af5

2. Received a lot of help from TA Brandon. I had moved my functions from the App.jsx file to SelectHorns.jsx file. Brandon consolidated my functions and guided me to move them back to App.jsx so it would be easier to use.
